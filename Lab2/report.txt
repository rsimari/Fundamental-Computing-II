To use this program a user will run the executable and then be prompted to enter the numerator then a space then a deonominator. It will then print your fraction and ask for another. Then my program will compute 5 different calculations +, -, *, /, and ~.  The +, -, *, / simply do that binary operator to the two frations and output the simplified result. The final operator is a unary operator that gives the reciprical of the fration.  Internally this program is a class called Rational. The rational class has multiple operators overloaded to make it easier to add, subtract, multiply, and divide the fractions from the Rational class. Each operator that is overloaded creates an instance of Rational and then is given its values derived from the two Rationals that used by the binary operator. I also used operator overloading for << and >> to make inputing and outputing the Rational class instances easier. These use iostreams and I add things to a stream and then return the stream so in main.cpp they can used with cin and cout. Finally a function is implemented that simplifies the fractions. It uses euclidean algorithm in the reduce function to divide the absolute values of the numerator and denominator by the greatest common denominator to get the fraction in the simpliest form.  I verified all my results by using a calculator to see if my operations were correct.
